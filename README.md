## üèÜ Mission Perplexity Hackathon

### Project Vision
NeuroTicker was created to address the gap between traditional financial analysis tools and geospatial data. By combining these domains, we enable investors to discover insights that would otherwise remain hidden in conventional platforms.

### Problem Statement
Traditional trading platforms lack geographic context for financial data, making it difficult for investors to understand regional market trends and correlations. NeuroTicker solves this by providing an intuitive interface that visualizes financial data on interactive maps.

### Innovation
Our platform's unique approach to combining financial data with geospatial visualization creates a new paradigm for market analysis. The integration with Alpaca Markets API allows for seamless trading capabilities within the same interface.
